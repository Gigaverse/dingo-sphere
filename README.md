# Dingo Sphere
###### A Super Monkey Ball inspired game for the Oculus Rift, PC, and Android Devices



###Current TO-DO List (Monday 26 October 2015):
* get a private github repo for this cancer game
* create a solid checkerboard and a ball model so we can roll the ball on the checkerboard
* learn how to move the mall by tilting the board instead of moving the ball
* make some dingo models
* start work some early 2000's-esque synth
* actually invite tane to this group
* possible gimmick: everything in the game is a 3d model including text and overlays
